in the black space. These fireballs ranged differently due to its type of core and are generally classifed into 8 categories. though many of these were given valid 
names some of it also has a relict history and name. The aim of this project is to discover and dig in to the various variables which might be responsible for the 
the falling of these objects and might help us in predicting the same. Also many insights and observations would be presented after applying data science tools.
