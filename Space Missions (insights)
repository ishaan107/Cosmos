From July 28, 1964 when Ranger 7 (Arianespace) launches and is the Ranger series' first success, taking photographs of the moon until it crashes into its surface 
four days later, to the rise of the most dominating space agency SpaceX of the 21st Century, this article consists of all the significant observations and analysis
of the Space missions and their Mission Status based on its various variables such as temp, company, wind speed etc. The Companies and the organisations which were 
a part of the study were - SpaceX, Boeing, US Airforce, Brazilian Space Agency, Martin Marietta, European Space Agency and Arianespace. Further more the later part 
of the article contains a screenshot of the code for the machine learning classifier which was trained on this data and could predict the what might be the mission 
status based on the input variables with an accuracy of 1.



About the Dataset:

The dataset used for the study consists basically of 150 rows and 18 columns or variables including 'Company', 'Launch Date', 'Launch Time', 'Launch Site','
Temperature (Â° F)', 'Wind speed (MPH)', 'Humidity (%)', 'Vehicle Type','Liftoff Thrust (kN)', 'Payload to Orbit (kg)', 'Rocket Height (m)',
'Fairing Diameter (m)', 'Payload Name', 'Payload Type','Payload Mass (kg)', 'Payload Orbit', 'Mission Status', 'Failure Reason'.


Insights and observations

1) Overall failure to success ratio since 1964-2020 is approximately 1:4.

2) Highest total number of missions was recorded by SpaceX.

3) Out of the all the Successful missions SpaceX and Boeing reported to have more than 70% of the success.

4) The decade of 1964-1974 was highly dominated by the US Air force Missions, following which The European Space Agency joined the race in 1980s . 
The period between 1990-2004 saw the evolution of space agencies such as  Brazilian Space Agency, Martin Marietta, Arianespace and Boeing. Though the former 
3 agencies launched missions rarely or some could barely survived Boeing emerged as an important agency in this period launching numerous space missions.
Later in the decade from 2005, the reign of new and modern emerging space super power SpaceX began to take a grip on the cosmic industry and they launched 
plenty successful space mission where the Arainespace also contributed a small part and companies such as Martin Marietta and BSA barely managed to survive and 
probably Succumbed from the race.

5) From 1964-1994 Vehicles such as 'VLS-1',
'Delta III 8930',
'Delta II 7425',
'Falcon Heavy',
'Titan IIIC',                    
'Titan IIIB',                      
'Delta II 7920-10'                
'Ariane 1',                        
'Delta II 7326',                   
'Titan III(24)B',                  
'Delta II 7426',                   
'Delta IV Heavy',                  
'Titan IIIA',                      
'Vega'                            
'Ariane 5 G',                      
'Delta II 7425-10C',               
'Ariane 42P',                      
'Ariane 5 ECA',                    
'Delta IV Medium+ (4,2)',          
'Titan II(23)G'
were used whereas in the upcmoing decade vehicles such as Delta and the Falcon series started to gain more popularity.

6) Vehicles such as Delta II 7920-10C,Delta II 7925 were basically used to a payload orbit of around 800 kgs from 1964-1994
thrn newer vehicles such as Delta II 7320-10C, and Falcon 1 and Falcon 9 were used. For the mass of upto 2500kgs falcon series Vehciles were used such
as falcon block 3 and block 5.

7) SpaceX payload orbit were majorly lower earth orbit, polar orbit, Sun earth orbit, suborbital and geostationary orbit.
AraineSpace payload orbit consisted of medium earth orbit, mars orbit and heliocentric orbit.
European space agency targetted lower earth orbit and geostationary transfer orbit.

8) Orbits such as:
Low Earth Orbit                
Geostationary Transfer Orbit    
Polar Orbit                     
Sun-Synchronous Orbit          
Medium Earth Orbit 
consisted of failed missions with the Low Earth orbit and Geostationary orbit ranked the highest across 1964-2020
Orbits like:
Heliocentric Orbit               
High Earth Orbit                
Sun/Earth Orbit                  
Earth-Moon L2                    
Suborbital                       
Mars Orbit   
had no failed missions across the mentioned time.

9)The Lower earth orbit has the minimum payload to orbit mass whereas the Earth moon l2 has the highest payload to orbit mass.

10) There were more number of Success missions  when the temperature was recorded between 30-90 degrees farhenheit whereas specifically between the range
50-95 recorded all the failure missions.

Plenty of other observations also can be found .
