Being a fairly moderate cosmic geek, and having a passion for the infinitely expanding area above the sky limits, I decided to use my knowledge of Data Science and Machine Learning to dig deeper into the activities relating to Space.

Right from Space missions to the unknown flying objects and many other vast areas of this field, analysing and observing the different aspects and variables and gathering some enlightening results from the same.

Furthermore each article would consist of Machine/deep learning model which would contribute an help the readers to tweak the input variables and self learn about the different situations and hopefully gain some informative knowledge out of it.
